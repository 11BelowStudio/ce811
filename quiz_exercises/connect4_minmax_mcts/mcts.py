# Connect 4 implementation for MCTS and Minimiz.
# University of Essex.
# M. Fairbank November 2021 for course CE811 Game Artificial Intelligence
# 
# Acknowedgements: 
# All of the graphics and some other code for the main game loop and minimax came from https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python
# Some of the connect4Board logic and MCTS algorithm came from https://github.com/floriangardin/connect4-mcts 
# Other designs are implemented from the Millington and Funge Game AI textbook chapter on Minimax.
