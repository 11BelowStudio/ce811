# The Obligatory README

I guess this is a readme for my CE811 repo?

Still not entirely sure about the structure of it yet.

Got a different branch entirely for the Java hanabi stuff,
probably gonna set up a different branch for the The Resistance
stuff and the Python Hanabi stuff, but I'm not entirely sure how
to get the stuff for this module up and running yet (or what
exactly the structure of the labs will be), so you'll have to
wait for that to happen I guess :shrug:

anyway if you're reading this, this is probably one of the branches for
the lab work (or one of the assignments) that involves the framework for
The Resistance.

thank u for ur patience
